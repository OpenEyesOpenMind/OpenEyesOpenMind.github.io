					<description><![CDATA[Hello 

I enjoyed all your art work and believe that each of them had a message for me. I really like this piece because when I look at this beautiful painting, I feel that the face you have created is calling me. It seems that he has a message for me to receieve. His  message to me is to let others know about the rich history of Persian Empire. I believe he wants me to observe what I have learned and educate others. Although, I see sorrow in his eye, I believe he is looking directly at me to convey his message. Thank you for this amazing exhibit.]]></description>
