In the midst of a world that ruled by force, violence, and war, Cyrus the Great peacefully instilled the humanitarian ideology. He gathered, restored, and laid the order of an empire that embraced differences and cultivated his people. As he marched and expanded the empire, different people were united.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong><em>Elements of Antiquity<\/em><\/strong>, reliefs and sculptures were carefully chosen to portray the significant role of values in establishing the great Persian empire. The selected artwork is used to define the culture that is the very soul of Iran. The sights of Persepolis and Pasargadae are awe striking even though only a subset of the reliefs carved out of solid rocks remain today. Inspired by what she saw, the artist researched this awe inspiring civilization and the feat of Cyrus. The process of painting first began in 2010 with the challenge of creating depth and dimension on canvas, bringing these ancient reliefs and sculptures back to life.<\/p>\n<p>What is most outstanding about the Achaemenids is their celebration of cultural diversity. The reliefs attest to heterogeneity and peace among the people of ancient Persia. In this collection, they are displayed as <strong>All Nations. <\/strong>Known as the \u201cbenevolent ruler\u201d<strong>, <\/strong>Cyrus the Great established the Persian empire based on tolerance and respect while ingraining a global approach in his people.\u00a0 The Achaemenid dynasty never shamed anyone\u2019s identity, nor hurt the pride of those they conquered. Successful negotiations were made rather than use of force, and in return for people\u2019s loyalty Cyrus provided security and peace.<\/p>\n<p>The mission of this collection is to promote awareness around the attributes the empire conveyed: kindness, diversity, tolerance, acceptance, strength, dignity, illumination, unity, glory, faith, liberty, grace, loyalty, devotion, fortitude, compassion, and hope.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Elements of Antiquity<\/em><\/strong> is comprised of thirty five paintings altogether, of which twenty are completed.<\/p>\n<p>It is the artist&#8217;s hope that this exhibition will provide a new insight and educate with a fresh perspective to clear many misconceptions falsely portrayed by the media, and to see the truth through the art.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Elements of Antiquity is a mirror to the past, a rediscovery reflecting Pasargadae, Persepolis, and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/286"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=286"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/286\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":564,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/286\/revisions\/564"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=286"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
