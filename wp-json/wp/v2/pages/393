She admires nature and science&#8212;from the tiniest raindrop and smallest plants, insects, and animals to planets, stars, and galaxies. This curiosity and love for learning manifests in various forms. As an educator, she embraces curiosity in children and sets high expectations for all learning styles. In story writing, her work has been referred to as \u201cpoetic, scientific, and symbolic\u201d. In curricula and lesson planning, units are objective, inquiry based and interdisciplinary with a systemic approach. As an artist, her work is truly reflective. Once inspired, she paints with a purpose and every painting tells a story.<\/p>\n<p>Hengameh holds a Masters degree in education and Bachelor\u2019s degrees in biology, philosophy, and sociology. Her educational experience has been in public schools and as a founding teacher at a private school with the belief of respecting every child\u2019s uniqueness and fulfilling their academic and social, emotional needs.<\/p>\n<p>Hengameh has been drawing for as long as she can remember. She&#8217;s interested in painting portraits and capturing unique facial expressions that attest to people\u2019s feelings. Learning about the arts, its connection to history and culture fascinate her and she\u2019s drawn to the importance of art and symbolism in stories and civilizations. Imaginative and reflective by nature, she enjoys taking long walks&#8212;watching how nature will surprise her, dancing, hiking, and sharing laughs with family and friends.<\/p>\n<p>Membership and affiliations: NAGC, SENG, MAGE, SCBWI, Learning and the Brain Society, Museum of Science, Museum of Fine Arts, deCordova, Boston Athenaeum, and Lexington Arts &amp; Crafts society.<\/p>\n<p><em>Hengameh<\/em> \u02dc <em>in the moment of<\/em> \u221e <em>joy<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To contact me email: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openeyesopenmind.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/HenyTaraz@gmail.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-517\" src=\"http:\/\/openeyesopenmind.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/HenyTaraz@gmail-300x40.png\" alt=\"HenyTaraz@gmail\" width=\"300\" height=\"40\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome Born in the ancient land of Persia (Iran), Hengameh grew up in New York [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/393"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=393"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/393\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":571,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/393\/revisions\/571"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=393"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
