The structure consists of large blocks of fine white limestone that stack up to 36 feet for the funerary chamber. The lowest step is the height of a man.<br \/>\nSome texts mention that Cyrus\u2019s tomb was erected by Cyrus prior to his departure. Surrounding the Tomb were columns (now in ruins) and a garden. There were two palaces at Pasargadae set in an extensive garden which had an irrigation system- stone lined water channels (this system is still seen today). It is said that Cyrus was very proud of his garden and took part in planting the trees and shrubs himself.<br \/>\nArchitecturally, the Tomb of Cyrus was distinctly different from the city and palace planning in other areas such as Babylonia and Assyria.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI am Cyrus who founded the empire of the Persians.
