This is where All Nations went through to pay homage to the King on New Year\u2019s Day, Nowruz festival. A multicultural empire, the influences of the subjects manifest in the art. Guarding the entrance, the enormous mythical animal is the mighty winged Persian lamasu which bears similarities to the Assyrian lamasu. The creature protects the inhabitants of Persia from evil forces.<br \/>\nThe Persian lamasu symbolizes the might of the nation. He appears adorned in jewels, is welcoming, yet stern. The Gate of All Nations in Persepolis has four columns between the gates. The columns are the ruins of Apadana Hall in Persepolis. In front of the columns are the remaining walls of the western fa\u00e7ade of Tachara, Darius\u2019s palace bearing reliefs of the immortals. The center panel contains Old Persian cuneiform by Artaxerxes. The wings above Persepolis are the wings of Ahuramazda (seen in many reliefs), the all powerful force of good against the evil force Ahriman. The Old Persian cuneiform writing around the left edge of the painting is Darius\u2019s prayer for Persia: <em>May Ahuramazda protect this country from enemies, from famine, and from lies and deceit.<\/em><br \/>\nThe overall design of the painting is Cyrus&#8217;s Cylinder unrolled.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Magnificence &#8211; Gate of all Nations Location: Persepolis Gate of all Nations was built by [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":38,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/57"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=57"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/57\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":553,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/57\/revisions\/553"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/38"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=57"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=57"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.OpenEyesOpenMind.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=57"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
