					<description><![CDATA[It was nice meeting you today! Welcome to the Stanley Elementary School! Being a librarian, I really like the way that you have provided a list of the resources that you used to create your art. It sets a good example for everyone, especially young students as to the importance of citing sources. Your art is beautiful! I love the rich, warm colors. Nice website! What platform did you use?

Best regards,

Laura (Larsson)]]></description>
